61,htoi19p,"“Silence” by Delirium, featuring Sarah McLachlan (make sure you get the unabridged 6:34 version and not the radio cut; it absolutely destroys its flow and harmony).

When I was 19, a friend of mine had just graduated boot camp. He came home and met both his best friend and I at his mom’s house and we headed out shortly after. But before we did, he sat in front of his sound system and just listened with his eyes closed to Orbital’s “Halcyon and On and On” (another excellent choice in this vein). I didn’t understand why then. Once I myself graduated boot camp, this song became for me what that song was to him—a reset of my soul from a hardening trauma that you can’t explain, you can only feel.

This song healed my soul. I hope you find the song that does for yourself."
